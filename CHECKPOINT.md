## Prompt Engineering Template

### Effective Prompting Patterns
1. For UI Changes:
   ```
   Can you [improve/fix/update] the [component] in [file] to [desired outcome]?
   Example: "Can you update the metrics cards in dashboard/home.html to show real-time data?"
   ```

2. For Feature Implementation:
   ```
   Let's implement [feature] in [component/file]. We need:
   - [requirement 1]
   - [requirement 2]
   - [requirement 3]
   Example: "Let's implement the subscription tracking in dashboard/models.py. We need: model definition, admin interface, etc."
   ```

3. For Troubleshooting:
   ```
   I'm seeing [issue] when [action]. Here's the error:
   [error message/behavior]
   Example: "I'm seeing migration errors when applying the new models."
   ```

4. For Documentation Updates:
   ```
   Let's update [doc file] to reflect [changes/progress] and [additional context].
   Example: "Let's update CHECKPOINT.md to document our recent dashboard implementation."
   ```

### Effective Response Patterns
The LLM has been most effective when:
1. Explaining changes before making them
2. Breaking down complex tasks into steps
3. Providing context for security implications
4. Checking file contents before modifications
5. Verifying directory locations before commands
6. Using conventional commit formats
7. Updating documentation alongside changes

## Next Steps
1. Implement course management features
   - Course creation/editing interface
   - Content organization system
   - Student enrollment tracking
2. Add content management system
   - File upload/management
   - Content versioning
   - Media handling
3. Implement assessment and grading features
   - Quiz creation
   - Assignment management
   - Grade tracking

## Security Considerations
- Using Django's session framework instead of localStorage
- Implementing secure cookie handling
- Proper CSRF protection
- XSS prevention
- SQL injection protection
- Secure file upload handling
- Password hashing
- Session management
- User authentication/authorization

## Testing Approach
- Manual testing of UI changes
- Checking responsive design
- Verifying dark mode functionality
- Testing user authentication flow
- Validating admin dashboard access
- Testing metrics calculations
- Verifying data processing
- Checking subscription tracking

## Known Issues
None currently pending - all recent issues have been resolved:
- Fixed login button readability
- Fixed missing admin dashboard template
- Implemented secure session handling
- Fixed message persistence issues
- Resolved migration issues with dashboard app

## Documentation Status
- TODO.md: Up to date with current progress
- NOTES.md: Contains all implementation details and troubleshooting
- CHECKPOINT.md: Updated with recent changes and next steps
