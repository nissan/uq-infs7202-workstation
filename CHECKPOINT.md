## Prompt Engineering Template

### Effective Prompting Patterns
1. For UI Changes:
   ```
   Can you [improve/fix/update] the [component] in [file] to [desired outcome]?
   Example: "Can you update the login button in accounts/login.html to have better text contrast?"
   ```

2. For Feature Implementation:
   ```
   Let's implement [feature] in [component/file]. We need:
   - [requirement 1]
   - [requirement 2]
   - [requirement 3]
   Example: "Let's implement the admin dashboard in dashboard/home.html. We need: metrics cards, recent activity, etc."
   ```

3. For Troubleshooting:
   ```
   I'm seeing [issue] when [action]. Here's the error:
   [error message/behavior]
   Example: "I'm seeing a TemplateDoesNotExist error when accessing the admin dashboard."
   ```

4. For Documentation Updates:
   ```
   Let's update [doc file] to reflect [changes/progress] and [additional context].
   Example: "Let's update NOTES.md to document our recent UI fixes and security improvements."
   ```

5. For Git Operations:
   ```
   Let's commit our changes with appropriate messages for [changes made].
   Example: "Let's commit our changes with appropriate messages for the login UI fix and admin dashboard addition."
   ```

### Effective Response Patterns
The LLM has been most effective when:
1. Explaining changes before making them
2. Breaking down complex tasks into steps
3. Providing context for security implications
4. Checking file contents before modifications
5. Verifying directory locations before commands
6. Using conventional commit formats
7. Updating documentation alongside changes

## Next Steps
1. Continue implementing admin dashboard functionality
2. Add metrics data processing
3. Implement course management features
4. Add content management system

## Security Considerations
- Using Django's session framework instead of localStorage
- Implementing secure cookie handling
- Proper CSRF protection
- XSS prevention
- SQL injection protection
- Secure file upload handling
- Password hashing
- Session management
- User authentication/authorization

## Testing Approach
- Manual testing of UI changes
- Checking responsive design
- Verifying dark mode functionality
- Testing user authentication flow
- Validating admin dashboard access
- Ensuring secure session handling

## Known Issues
None currently pending - all recent issues have been resolved:
- Fixed login button readability
- Fixed missing admin dashboard template
- Implemented secure session handling
- Fixed message persistence issues

## Documentation Status
- TODO.md: Up to date with current progress
- NOTES.md: Contains all implementation details and troubleshooting
- CHECKPOINT.md: Created for session continuity
