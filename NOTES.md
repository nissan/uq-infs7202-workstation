# Implementation Notes

## Server Startup Issue (2024-03-21)

### Error Description
When attempting to start the Django development server with `python manage.py runserver`, we encountered the following error:
```
ValueError: Dependency on app with no migrations: accounts
```

### Root Cause
The error indicates that there's a dependency on the `accounts` app, but this app doesn't have any migrations set up. This typically happens when:
1. A new app is added to INSTALLED_APPS but migrations haven't been created
2. There are dependencies between apps that reference the `accounts` app

### Investigation Findings
1. The `accounts` app is properly configured in `INSTALLED_APPS`
2. The app has a migrations directory with an initial migration file (`0001_initial.py`)
3. The app defines a custom User model that extends `AbstractUser`
4. The custom User model is properly configured in settings.py with `AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.User'`

### Migration Error
When attempting to run migrations, we encountered a new error:
```
django.db.migrations.exceptions.InconsistentMigrationHistory: Migration admin.0001_initial is applied before its dependency accounts.0001_initial on database 'default'
```

This error occurs because:
1. The admin app's migrations were applied before the accounts app's migrations
2. The admin app depends on the accounts app (since we're using a custom user model)
3. This creates an inconsistent migration history

### Solution & Resolution
To resolve this issue, we executed the following commands:

1. First, we removed the existing database:
```bash
rm djangoapps/learnmore_plus/db.sqlite3
```

2. Navigated to the project directory:
```bash
cd djangoapps/learnmore_plus
```

3. Activated the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Created migrations:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
# Output: No changes detected
```

5. Applied migrations in the correct order:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
# Output:
# Operations to perform:
#   Apply all migrations: account, accounts, admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions, sites, socialaccount
# Running migrations:
#   Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
#   Applying contenttypes.0002_remove_content_type_name... OK
#   Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
#   [Additional migrations applied successfully...]
```

The server now starts successfully without any migration errors.

### Additional Warnings
The server also showed some deprecation warnings related to django-allauth settings:
- `ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD` is deprecated
- `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED` is deprecated
- `ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED` is deprecated

These should be updated to use the new settings format:
- `ACCOUNT_LOGIN_METHODS = {'username', 'email'}`
- `ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FIELDS = ['email*', 'username*', 'password1*', 'password2*']`
