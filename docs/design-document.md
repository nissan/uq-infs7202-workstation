# Database Design

This document outlines the comprehensive database schema for the Enhanced LearnMore platform, a multi-tenant SaaS application designed for educational institutions and content creators. The design leverages Django's built-in functionality while extending it with custom models to support specialized features.

## Core Architecture Components

1. **Multi-tenant SaaS Architecture**
2. **Institution & User Management**
3. **Course Content Management**
4. **Assessment & Progress Tracking**
5. **QR Code & Sharing System**
6. **RAG & AI Tutor Implementation**
7. **Personalization & Collaboration**
8. **Gamification Features**

## Django Built-in Models Integration

The system leverages Django's robust built-in models for authentication, permissions, and content management:

| Django Model | Usage in Our System | Documentation Link |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| `auth.User` | Base authentication and user management | [User Model Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/contrib/auth/#user-model) |
| `auth.Group` | Permission groups for institutional roles | [Group Model Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/contrib/auth/#group-model) |
| `auth.Permission` | Fine-grained access controls for courses and content | [Permission Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/contrib/auth/#permissions) |
| `admin.LogEntry` | Administrative audit trail for course management | [Admin Log Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/contrib/admin/#logentry-model) |
| `sessions.Session` | Learning session management and tracking | [Session Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/sessions/) |
| `contenttypes.ContentType` | Polymorphic relationships for ContentAccessPolicy and QuizTimeOverride | [ContentTypes Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/contrib/contenttypes/) |

## Database Design Decisions and Rationale

| Design Decision | Rationale | Alternative Considered |
|-----------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Content Blocks for modular content** | â€¢ Supports complex content editing and modular management<br>â€¢ Enables rich content experiences<br>â€¢ Aligns with block-based editor in UI mockups | Single-content records were simpler but lacked flexibility for complex layouts |
| **QR Print Configurations** | â€¢ Enables reusable, customized QR code sheets<br>â€¢ Matches QR code management interface<br>â€¢ Improves user efficiency | One-time configurations would lack the reusability shown in mockups |
| **Quiz Timer Overrides** | â€¢ Ensures accessibility and institutional flexibility<br>â€¢ Supports accommodations for diverse learners<br>â€¢ Aligns with accessibility features in mockups | Static quiz timing would be simpler but insufficient for accessibility needs |
| **Board Interaction Analytics** | â€¢ Provides richer collaboration insights<br>â€¢ Enables detailed analytics visualizations<br>â€¢ Supports engagement metrics | Simple view tracking would be inadequate for the analytics shown in mockups |
| **Subscription tied to institution or individual** | â€¢ Supports both B2B and B2C business models<br>â€¢ Allows transition from individual to institutional accounts<br>â€¢ Flexible pricing structure | Separate models for individual/institutional would be clearer but create duplication |
| **Department sub-structure** | â€¢ Reflects real-world organizational structures<br>â€¢ Enables delegated administration<br>â€¢ Supports course organization by department | Flatter structure would be simpler but limit institutional use cases |
| **Course sharing between institutions** | â€¢ Enables collaborative education scenarios<br>â€¢ Supports educational partnerships<br>â€¢ Creates network effects and content marketplace potential | Strict tenant isolation would be more secure but limit collaboration value |
| **LLM interaction logging** | â€¢ Comprehensive storage of user-LLM conversations<br>â€¢ Supports tutor improvement and analytics<br>â€¢ Enables personalization based on conversation history | Minimal logging would reduce storage needs but limit AI tutor effectiveness shown in mockups |

## Responsive Design Approach

The mockups demonstrate responsive design across different viewport sizes:
- Mobile View: Optimized for small screens with touch-friendly interface
- Tablet View: Balanced layout with two-column design
- Desktop View: Full-featured interface with multi-column layout

All interfaces are built using the Bootstrap CSS framework's responsive grid system and components. Key responsive design principles implemented include:

1. **Mobile-First Approach**: 
   - Core functionality designed for smaller screens first
   - Progressive enhancement for larger screens
   - Touch-friendly interface elements

2. **Responsive Navigation**:
   - Collapsible navbar with hamburger menu on small screens
   - Sidebar navigation converts to bottom navigation or dropdown on mobile
   - Breadcrumbs adapt to available width

3. **Flexible Content Layout**:
   - Single-column layout on mobile
   - Two-column layout on tablet
   - Multi-column layout on desktop
   - Proper spacing adjustments between breakpoints

4. **Adaptive Components**:
   - Cards reflow from grid to single column
   - Tables convert to card views on small screens
   - Modal dialogs adjust to screen size
   - Form layouts reflow for smaller screens

5. **Content Prioritization**:
   - Critical content remains visible across all devices
   - Secondary content collapses to expandable sections on mobile
   - Different information density based on screen size

These design approaches ensure the platform provides an optimal user experience regardless of the device used to access it.

## Authentication Flow Considerations

The authentication system is designed to support both individual users and institutional affiliations:

1. **Individual Authentication**
   - Standard email/password registration
   - Social login options (Google, GitHub, etc.)
   - Email verification process
   - Progressive profile completion

2. **Institutional Authentication**
   - SSO integration (OAuth, SAML)
   - Automatic institutional affiliation
   - Role assignment based on institutional data
   - Seamless access to institutional courses

3. **Access Control**
   - Course-level access permissions
   - Institutional membership verification
   - Request and approval workflow for restricted courses
   - Institutional administrator oversight

This comprehensive authentication approach ensures that users can easily access content appropriate to their role and institutional affiliation while providing necessary security and access controls for institutional content.

## HTML Mockup Development Strategy

To create the actual HTML mockups:

1. Use the LLM prompts provided above to generate initial HTML/CSS for each mockup using Bootstrap CSS framework
2. Refine and standardize the generated code to ensure consistency across all mockups
3. Implement responsive design patterns specific to our platform requirements
4. Add appropriate interactivity using minimal JavaScript for UI elements (dropdowns, modals, etc.)
5. Test all mockups across different devices and screen sizes
6. Take screenshots of the completed mockups to include in the design document
7. Package all HTML files with required CSS and JavaScript for submission

[Note: The HTML mockups are included as separate files in the submission. The images above represent screenshots from the HTML mockups in the final document.]

# Technology Research

## Evaluation of LLM Integration Options

The core innovation of the Enhanced LearnMore platform is its AI-powered tutoring system. Throughout the development process, careful consideration was given to potential technical and organizational risks. A structured risk assessment was conducted to identify high-impact concerns â€” particularly around multi-tenancy complexity, AI tutor reliability, and the use of generative AI tools for development acceleration. Mitigation strategies have been proactively planned and are detailed in the [Known Risks & Mitigations](#appendix-known-risks--mitigations) appendix.
 We evaluated several approaches for implementing the LLM integration:

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Implementation Complexity |
|----------|------|------|---------------------------|
| OpenAI API (GPT-4) | - High quality responses<br>- Robust API<br>- Strong documentation | - Usage costs<br>- External dependency<br>- Data privacy concerns | Medium |
| Local LLM via Ollama (Phi-3) | - No recurring costs<br>- Data privacy<br>- Complete control | - Hardware requirements<br>- Limited capabilities<br>- Setup complexity | High |
| Hybrid Approach | - Flexibility<br>- Optimal cost-performance<br>- Fallback options | - Complex implementation<br>- Consistency challenges<br>- Multiple integrations | High |

### Decision: Hybrid Approach with Configuration Options

After careful evaluation, we have chosen to implement a hybrid approach that allows:

1. **Primary Option**: Local deployment via Ollama for standard tutoring interactions, minimizing costs and protecting privacy
2. **Enhanced Option**: Integration with OpenAI's API through configurable "course codes" for advanced capabilities
3. **User Choice**: Setting at the user level to determine preferred LLM based on learning preferences

This approach balances performance, cost, and flexibility. The implementation will include:

- Unified messaging interface compatible with multiple LLM backends
- Configuration system for API keys and model preferences
- Caching mechanisms to improve efficiency
- Fallback options if primary LLM is unavailable

## Evaluation of Authentication and Institutional Integration

Another critical technology decision involved selecting the authentication and institutional integration approach:

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Implementation Complexity |
|----------|------|------|---------------------------|
| Email/Password Only | - Simple implementation<br>- Full control<br>- No external dependencies | - Poor user experience<br>- Security burden<br>- No institutional integration | Low |
| Social Login | - Improved user experience<br>- Delegated security<br>- Quick registration | - Platform dependency<br>- Limited institutional features<br>- Privacy considerations | Medium |
| Custom SSO Integration | - Full institutional support<br>- Enterprise-grade security<br>- Robust identity management | - Complex implementation<br>- Maintenance overhead<br>- Protocol variations | High |
| Hybrid with Domain Verification | - Flexible user options<br>- Institutional verification<br>- Balance of UX and security | - More complex than simpler options<br>- Multiple integration points<br>- Requires careful testing | Medium-High |

### Decision: Hybrid Authentication with Domain Verification

We have selected a hybrid authentication approach that combines:

1. **Standard Authentication**: Email/password registration with verification
2. **Social Login**: Integration with popular providers (Google, GitHub)
3. **Institutional SSO**: Support for SAML and OAuth-based institutional SSO
4. **Domain Verification**: Email domain-based institutional affiliation

This balanced approach offers:
- Maximum flexibility for different user types
- Support for institutional identity management
- Enhanced security through delegated authentication
- Streamlined user experience for all access patterns

The implementation includes database structures to support multiple authentication methods and institutional affiliations while maintaining a unified user identity throughout the platform. 
These architectural decisions were made not only to optimize performance and scalability, but also to mitigate technical risks identified during planning (see [Known Risks & Mitigations](#appendix-known-risks--mitigations)).

## Appendix: Known Risks & Mitigations

The following table outlines key risks identified in the development of the Enhanced LearnMore platform, along with corresponding mitigation strategies. These risks span technical, organizational, and process domains, and have been assessed based on their potential impact on successful project delivery.

| **Risk** | **Description** | **Impact** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
|----------|----------------|------------|--------------------------|
| **Scope Creep from Feature Ambition** | With an ambitious feature set, there is a risk of exceeding the implementation capacity within the semester timeline. | High | Core features have been prioritized using a phased development timeline. Stretch features are explicitly marked as out-of-scope for initial release. |
| **Multi-Tenant SaaS Complexity** | Supporting institutional multi-tenancy introduces complexity in access control, data isolation, and permission management. | Mediumâ€“High | Djangoâ€™s permission framework and content type relationships are used to abstract access controls. Tenant-aware views and queries are implemented early. |
| **AI Tutor Integration Reliability** | Dependence on LLM APIs (OpenAI or local Ollama) may lead to unpredictable latency or downtime. | Medium | A fallback LLM strategy is implemented (hybrid mode). Caching and retry logic are added for resilience. |
| **Accessibility Implementation Overhead** | Implementing and testing full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components may be time-consuming. | Medium | Accessibility testing is integrated into the front-end development cycle. Features like alt text, keyboard nav, and contrast compliance are verified progressively. |
| **Generative AI Development Risk** | The team is leveraging GenAI tools (e.g. Claude, ChatGPT, v0.dev) to accelerate development and reduce boilerplate coding. However, generated code may lack transparency or correctness, impacting the ability to confidently defend, debug, or extend it. | Mediumâ€“High | All GenAI-assisted code is reviewed manually with emphasis on understanding logic and edge cases. Complex components are tested and documented to ensure explainability. If AI output is ambiguous, fallback to manual implementation is used. A code acceptance checklist has been adopted for critical paths. |

**Use of GenAI and other tools:**
- Claude (Anthropic) was used extensively for brainstorming features, designing the database schema, and developing the overall architecture described in this document.
- V0 by Vercel was used to generate the initial HTML mockups based on our design specifications, with Bootstrap CSS as the styling framework.
- Mermaid.js was used for generating all database diagrams and the Gantt chart timeline.
- dbdiagram.io was used to refine and visualize some of the database relationships.
- The database models were developed with assistance from Claude to ensure alignment with Django's ORM patterns.
- The institutional integration features were developed through iterative discussions with Claude to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- A combination of Claude, Deepseek, and ChatGPT was used to evaluate and refine manual edits, ensuring consistency and quality throughout the document.
- These AI tools were also instrumental in extracting and structuring Django models from the site documentation during the database design phase.
- All mockups and code were manually reviewed and adjusted after initial AI generation to ensure they meet the specific requirements of this project.
