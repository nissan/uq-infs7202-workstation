# Test Coverage for Demo Scenarios

This document maps the automated Playwright tests to the demo scenarios described in the README.md. This helps ensure we have comprehensive test coverage for all key user journeys and features.

## Test Structure Overview

Our test suite is organized into several categories:

1. **Role-Based Tests**: Tests specific user journeys for each role (student, instructor, coordinator, admin)
2. **Feature-Specific Tests**: Tests for specific features like QR codes, courses, authentication
3. **Visual/UI Tests**: Tests for visual aspects and UI framework implementation
4. **Demo Scenario Tests**: Tests specifically covering the demo scenarios in the README

## Visual Verification Tests

Aside from functional tests, we've implemented visual verification tests to ensure UI consistency:

| Visual Aspect | Test File | Test Name | Status |

| Tailwind Color Scheme Verification | tailwind-visual-regression.spec.js | should maintain consistent styling in light and dark mode | Implemented |
| Tailwind Class Usage Verification | tailwind-visual-regression.spec.js | should use Tailwind CSS for component styling (not Bootstrap) | Implemented |
| QR Code Modal Tailwind Styling | tailwind-visual-regression.spec.js | should verify QR code modal styling with Tailwind | Implemented |
| Tailwind Responsive Breakpoints | tailwind-visual-regression.spec.js | should verify responsive layout with Tailwind breakpoints | Implemented |

## Additional Tests Needed

While we have great coverage, we should consider adding these additional tests:

1. **Accessibility Tests**
   - Keyboard navigation through critical flows
   - Screen reader compatibility tests
   - Focus management tests for modals and interactive elements

2. **Performance Tests**
   - Page load time tests
   - Component rendering performance
   - API response time tests

3. **Edge Case Tests**
   - Test behavior with many enrollments
   - Test with extremely long content
   - Test with various browser zoom levels

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all demo scenario tests
./run-demo-tests.sh

# Run tests for a specific user role
npx playwright test student-demo.spec.js --project=chromium
npx playwright test instructor-demo.spec.js --project=chromium
npx playwright test coordinator-demo.spec.js --project=chromium
npx playwright test admin-demo.spec.js --project=chromium

# Run visual verification tests
npx playwright test visual-verification.spec.js --project=chromium

# Run QR code feature tests
npx playwright test qr-codes.spec.js --project=chromium
```

## Test Maintenance

When making changes to the application, consider these guidelines:

1. **UI Changes**: Update visual verification tests when making UI changes
2. **Workflow Changes**: Update role-based tests when changing user workflows
3. **New Features**: Add tests for new features in the appropriate test files
4. **Component Changes**: Update page objects when refactoring components

Remember that each test should be independent and should not depend on the state created by another test. Use the Page Object Model pattern to keep tests maintainable and organize common functionality.
