## Priority Areas for Additional Tests

Based on our latest analysis, these are the remaining priority areas for test development:

### 1. LLM Backend and RAG Features Tests
- LLM backend switching functionality
- RAG retrieval verification
- Error handling for AI services

### 2. Content Version Control Tests
- Content versioning features
- Version history viewing
- Version comparison functionality
- Version rollback process

### 3. Internationalization Tests
- Language switching
- Localized content display
- Date/time formatting
- Right-to-left language support (if implemented)

### 4. ✅ QR Code Distribution Flow Tests
- ✅ QR code scanning flow (implemented in qr-code-scanning.spec.js)
- ✅ Mobile device QR code simulation (implemented in qr-code-scanning.spec.js)
- ✅ QR code distribution to students (implemented in qr-codes.spec.js)
- ✅ Manual code entry fallback (implemented in qr-code-scanning.spec.js)

### 5. Advanced Performance Testing
- Large course catalog performance
- Concurrent user simulation
- Backend response time measurement
- Resource usage optimization

## Test Implementation Plan

For each missing test area, we will:

1. Create a page object model (if needed)
2. Implement core test cases
3. Add edge case testing
4. Integrate into the test suite with appropriate run configuration

The tests will follow our existing patterns of:
- Maximum resilience with multiple selector fallbacks
- Comprehensive screenshot capture
- Clear failure messaging
- Appropriate skipping when features are unavailable

## Test Organization and Execution

We have implemented both explicit test listing and a tag-based approach to organize our tests:

### Test Execution

Our `run-critical-tests.sh` script executes each test file explicitly, providing:
- Clear visibility into which tests are running
- Control over the execution order
- Easy tracking of our test implementation progress

### Test Tags

Additionally, we've implemented a tagging system for future flexibility:

- `@critical` - Core functionality tests that must pass for the application to be considered operational
- Additional tags for future implementation: `@smoke`, `@regression`, `@performance`, `@accessibility`

### Running Tests

To run our tests:

```bash
# Run all critical tests in sequence
./run-critical-tests.sh

# Run specific test files
npx playwright test file-name.spec.js --project=chromium

# Run tests by tag (future enhancement)
npx playwright test --project=chromium --grep="@critical"
```

For more details on our test tagging approach, see [TEST-TAGS.md](./TEST-TAGS.md).

### Progress Tracking

We maintain a clear list of implemented tests in `run-critical-tests.sh`, making it easy to track our progress. Each test file corresponds to a specific feature area, and the script serves as a checklist of completed test implementation.
