# Course and Quiz Test Fixes

This document summarizes the improvements made to course and quiz-related tests to make them more resilient and reliable.

## Current Test Status

| Test Category | Test File | Status | Details |
|---------------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Course Access | basic-course-verification.spec.js | ✅ PASSING | Successfully accesses course catalog |
| Quiz Access | basic-quiz-verification.spec.js | ⚠️ SKIPPED | No quiz content found to test |
| Tailwind CSS | tailwind-visual-regression.spec.js | ✅ PASSING | All tests pass, one test skipped |
| QR Code System | qr-codes.spec.js | ❌ FAILING | Cannot find course cards to click |

## Improvements Made

1. **More Resilient Course Catalog Page Object**
   - Added multiple selector patterns for finding course cards
   - Improved error handling in `clickFirstCourse()` method
   - Added special error for empty state detection

2. **Safer Navigation Helper Functions**
   - Created `safeGoto()` for more resilient navigation
   - Added error page detection to avoid proceeding with invalid pages
   - Added multiple URL path attempts for finding content

3. **More Resilient Demo Scenario Tests**
   - Updated published courses test with better error handling
   - Improved empty courses test with multiple empty state detection methods
   - Added course state verification with multiple indicator detectors

4. **Minimalistic Verification Tests**
   - Created basic-course-verification.spec.js for minimal course access testing
   - Created basic-quiz-verification.spec.js for minimal quiz access testing
   - Focused on just verifying access rather than complex behavior

## Current Issues

1. **Test Data Availability**
   - Course catalog seems to exist but may not have actual courses
   - No quiz content was found through any navigation path
   - QR code tests still fail because they depend on course detail pages

2. **Timeouts**
   - Some tests still time out when scanning for content
   - Increased timeouts only delay the inevitable failure

3. **UI Inconsistencies**
   - Selectors in tests may not match actual implementation
   - Some expected content may not be present in the current state

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Seed Test Data**
   - Run `python manage.py reset_db` to seed demo data
   - Confirm course and quiz data existence manually before running tests

2. **Create Test-Specific Routes**
   - Add debug endpoints that expose content directly for testing
   - Consider adding test-specific fixtures that guarantee content

3. **Update Default Test Values**
   - Update test selectors based on actual HTML examination
   - Update expected course and quiz names to match seeded data

4. **Improve Test Isolation**
   - Make tests less dependent on specific data
   - Create isolated test environments with controlled data

## Summary

The basic access tests confirm we can at least reach the course catalog page, but the application may not have seeded course and quiz data. The Tailwind CSS tests pass, showing that the UI framework is correctly implemented. The course and quiz functionality tests have been made more resilient, but still need actual data to work with.

Our fixes focus on making the tests more adaptable to different application states, but ultimately they need properly seeded test data to fully pass.
