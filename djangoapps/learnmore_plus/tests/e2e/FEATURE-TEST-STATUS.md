## Recent Fixes

1. **Fixed QR Code Statistics View**
   - Updated annotation name from `scan_count` to `total_scans` to avoid field conflict
   - Fixed ordering in the query to match the new annotation name

2. **Fixed QR Code URL Routes**
   - Updated tests to use `/qr/` instead of `/qr-codes/` to match actual implementation
   - Updated the page objects to use the correct routes

3. **Improved Tailwind Visual Regression Tests**
   - Made tests more resilient by handling transparent backgrounds
   - Added better detection of theme changes
   - Fixed responsive layout verification to be more flexible

## Required Fixes to Make Tests Pass

1. **Course Data Availability**
   - Tests expect specific course data that may not be available in the test environment
   - Need to ensure demo data is properly seeded before tests run

2. **UI Selector Updates**
   - Many tests fail because selectors like `.course-card` can't be found
   - Need to update page objects and test selectors to match current HTML structure

3. **URL/Routing Structure**
   - Several tests fail trying to access pages at URLs that return 404
   - Need to update test URLs to match current routing configuration

4. **Authentication Flow**
   - Some tests can log in but then can't access expected features
   - Might need to update role permissions or test user credentials

## Next Steps

1. Update the course catalog page object to handle cases where no courses are available
2. Implement more flexibility in selectors to handle UI variations
3. Verify all URLs and routes match current implementation
4. Ensure test data is properly seeded for comprehensive testing
5. Consider adding test-specific routes or mock data to ensure consistent test environment
