# LearnMore Plus Playwright Test Suite Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Playwright E2E test suite for LearnMore Plus, including test organization, coverage areas, and implementation patterns.

## Test Suite Organization

The test suite follows a structured organization:

1. **Page Objects** (`/page-objects/`)
   - Encapsulate UI interactions for specific pages
   - Provide resilient selectors with fallbacks
   - Handle different application states gracefully

2. **Test Files** (`/tests/`)
   - Organized by feature area
   - Tagged with `@critical` for must-pass tests
   - Include comprehensive screenshots for debugging

3. **Test Execution** (`/run-*.sh`)
   - Scripts for running different test subsets
   - Explicit test execution order for better tracking
   - Clear output formatting for easy status monitoring

## Feature Coverage

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage for all major features of LearnMore Plus:

### User Management and Authentication
- User registration and login
- Social authentication (Google)
- Role-based access control verification
- Profile management and settings

### Course Management
- Course creation and editing
- Module and content organization
- Student enrollment and progress tracking
- Course search and filtering

### Assessment System
- Quiz creation with multiple question types
- Quiz taking workflow with timeouts
- Assignment submission and grading
- Progress tracking and prerequisites

### AI Tutor System
- Chat interface functionality
- Context-aware responses (course, module, content)
- Session management
- Conversation history

### QR Code System
- QR code generation and display
- Scanning simulation and redirection
- Statistics tracking
- Manual code entry fallback

### UI/UX
- Responsive design verification
- Dark mode support
- Accessibility compliance
- Component styling consistency

## Implementation Patterns

The test suite employs several key implementation patterns:

### 1. Resilient Selectors

Tests use multiple selector patterns to handle UI variations:

```javascript
const selectors = [
  '.course-card',
  '.card.course',
  'a[href*="/courses/"]',
  'a:has-text("Python")',
  'a:has-text("Web Development")',
];

// Try each selector until one works
for (const selector of selectors) {
  const element = page.locator(selector);
  if (await element.count() > 0) {
    await element.click();
    break;
  }
}
```

### 2. Comprehensive Screenshot Capture

Screenshots are taken at key points for debugging:

```javascript
// Take screenshot before interaction
await page.screenshot({ path: 'before-action.png', fullPage: true });

// Perform action
await someButton.click();

// Take screenshot after interaction
await page.screenshot({ path: 'after-action.png', fullPage: true });
```

### 3. Conditional Test Skipping

Tests gracefully skip when features are unavailable:

```javascript
if (!foundFeature) {
  console.log('Feature not available in this environment');
  test.skip(true, 'Feature not available');
  return;
}
```

### 4. Tagging System

Tests are tagged for organization and selective execution:

```javascript
// Critical test tag defined in critical-tests.js
test('should verify important functionality', async ({ page }) => {
  // Test code here
});
```

## Running Tests

To execute the test suite:

```bash
# Run all critical tests in sequence
./run-critical-tests.sh

# Run specific test files
npx playwright test file-name.spec.js --project=chromium

# Run with debugging enabled
npx playwright test --debug

# Generate and view report
npx playwright show-report
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Test fails to find elements**
   - Check that test data is properly seeded
   - Review screenshots for UI structure
   - Verify selector patterns match current UI

2. **Authentication failures**
   - Ensure test users exist with correct credentials
   - Verify permission assignments for test users
   - Check for cookie/session handling issues

3. **Timeouts**
   - Adjust timeouts for complex operations
   - Ensure proper waiting for network requests
   - Check for performance bottlenecks

## Future Development

Areas for test suite expansion:

1. **LLM and RAG Functionality**
   - Backend switching tests
   - RAG retrieval verification
   - Error handling for AI services

2. **Content Version Control**
   - Version history viewing
   - Version comparison
   - Rollback functionality

3. **Internationalization**
   - Language switching
   - Localized content display
   - Right-to-left language support

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Large catalog performance
   - Concurrent user simulation
   - Resource usage optimization

## Maintenance Best Practices

When maintaining or extending the test suite:

1. **Follow Existing Patterns**
   - Use similar selector strategies
   - Match screenshot naming conventions
   - Follow the established page object model

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Keep coverage documentation current
   - Document new test patterns
   - Update the test status report

3. **Balance Resilience and Specificity**
   - Make tests robust but not overly complex
   - Use specific assertions when possible
   - Balance flexibility with clear failure messages

4. **Integrate New Tests**
   - Add to the appropriate run script
   - Include proper tagging
   - Consider execution order for dependencies
