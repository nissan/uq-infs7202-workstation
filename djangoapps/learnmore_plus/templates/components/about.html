      LearnMore Plus was founded in 2023 by a team of educators and technologists who saw the need for more effective and engaging online learning tools. Our founders experienced firsthand the challenges of remote education during the global pandemic and were inspired to create a platform that combines the best aspects of traditional education with cutting-edge technology.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
      We started with a simple idea: create a learning platform that adapts to each student's unique needs while giving educators powerful tools to create engaging content. After months of development and testing with educational institutions, LearnMore Plus was born.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      Today, we're proud to serve thousands of students and educators worldwide, continually improving our platform based on user feedback and advances in educational technology.
