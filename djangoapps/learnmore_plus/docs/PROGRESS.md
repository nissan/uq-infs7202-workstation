## Feature Implementation Details

### QR Code System

The QR code system includes the following components:

1. **QR Code Model**:
   - Uses Django's ContentType framework for generic relationships
   - Can generate QR codes for any model instance (course, module, etc.)
   - Tracks usage statistics including scan count

2. **QR Code Service**:
   - Provides methods for creating and retrieving QR codes
   - Handles scan tracking and analytics
   - Optimizes image storage and retrieval

3. **QR Code Interface**:
   - Modal interface for viewing and downloading QR codes
   - Module selection for individual module QR codes
   - Printable PDF sheet generation for easy distribution

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Course detail page includes QR code display
   - Module QR codes for direct access to specific content
   - Statistics page for tracking engagement

5. **Key Technologies Used**:
   - `qrcode` library for generation
   - `weasyprint` for PDF exports
   - Django's ContentType framework for polymorphic relationships

### AI Tutor System

The AI tutor system includes the following components:

1. **AI Tutor Models**:
   - Session management for persistent conversations
   - Message history with metadata tracking
   - Context items for RAG implementation
   - Content embeddings for vector search

2. **LLM Integration**:
   - Abstraction layer for multiple LLM providers
   - Local development support with Ollama
   - Production support for cloud providers
   - Configuration options for model selection

3. **Content Indexing**:
   - Vector embeddings of course content
   - Semantic search capabilities
   - Relevance ranking of content items
   - Content chunk management

4. **Tutor Interface**:
   - Three-panel responsive design
   - Course navigation and content browsing
   - Real-time chat with typing indicators
   - Reference material display

5. **Integration Points**:
   - Course detail page AI tutor link
   - Learning interface sidebar integration
   - Main navigation for authenticated users
   - Session management via dashboard

6. **Key Technologies Used**:
   - Langchain for LLM abstraction
   - ChromaDB for vector storage
   - Sentence Transformers for embeddings
   - Django's template system for UI

## Next Steps

1. Implement quiz functionality with custom time overrides for accessibility
2. Enhance admin dashboard with detailed analytics
3. Implement advanced AI tutor analytics
4. Complete testing with various LLM backends
5. Optimize vector database for production

## Technologies Used

- Django 4.2+
- Tailwind CSS
- qrcode
- weasyprint
- Django-allauth
- Langchain
- ChromaDB
- Sentence Transformers
- Ollama (for local LLM development)

## Known Issues and Solutions

- Need to verify mobile scanning functionality
- Need to add pagination to the scan history view
- Need to improve layout of QR code print template
- AI Tutor may need additional error handling for failed LLM calls
- Vector database needs proper initialization on first run
- Consider adding caching for frequently accessed embeddings
- Add more comprehensive test suite for AI Tutor functionality
- Provide better user feedback when LLM backend is unavailable

### Fixed Issues

- **UI Framework Consistency**: Replaced all Bootstrap components with Tailwind CSS equivalents to maintain consistent styling and dark mode compatibility. Most recently, refactored the QR code modal from a Bootstrap implementation to a pure Tailwind CSS solution.

- **Import Path Errors**: Fixed import references in management commands to use proper app-relative paths (e.g., `from apps.courses.models` instead of `from courses.models`). This prevents `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions when running commands.

- **Migration Handling**: Added robust migration checking and automatic creation for the AI Tutor app. The `seed_ai_tutor_demo` command now detects when tables are missing and automatically creates and applies migrations before proceeding.

- **App Label Configuration**: Set explicit app label (`label = 'ai_tutor'`) in the AiTutorConfig to ensure consistent app naming throughout the Django project, particularly for migrations.

- **Fix Script**: Created `fix_ai_tutor.sh` script to automate common setup tasks and resolve migration/database issues with a single command.

- **Embedding Model Error Handling**: Improved error handling for missing Ollama embedding models. The system now gracefully falls back to alternatives when `nomic-embed-text` is not available, and the `fix_ai_tutor.sh` script automatically pulls required Ollama models.

- **Graceful Degradation**: Enhanced AI Tutor services to continue functioning even when optimal embedding models are unavailable, using appropriate fallbacks instead of crashing.

- **LangChain Deprecation Warnings**: Updated imports and code to address LangChain deprecation warnings:
  - Replaced `langchain_community.embeddings` with `langchain_huggingface` and `langchain_ollama` packages
  - Replaced `langchain_community.vectorstores` with `langchain_chroma` package
  - Removed deprecated `vector_store.persist()` calls as Chroma 0.4.x+ automatically persists data
  - Updated package requirements to include these dedicated provider packages

- **Documentation Updates**: Enhanced documentation in AI tutor demo guide, feature documentation, and technical implementation guide to reflect the updated LangChain integration and required Ollama models.

- **Template Syntax Issues**: Fixed template syntax issues in multiple components that were causing rendering errors on the home page:
  - Identified and resolved issues with nested `{% with %}` and `{% if %}` blocks
  - Rewrote key template components using a more robust pattern for default values
  - Created a `check_templates.py` tool for automated template syntax checking
  - Added comprehensive tests to detect template nesting issues
  - Added detailed documentation on proper template patterns in `docs/template-patterns.md`
  - The landing page and all components now render correctly
