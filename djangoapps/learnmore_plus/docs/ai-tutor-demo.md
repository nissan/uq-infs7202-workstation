# AI Tutor Demo Guide

This guide provides instructions for demonstrating the AI Tutor feature in the LearnMore+ platform.

## Setup

Before running the demo, make sure you have:

1. Installed all dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/base.txt
   
   # Make sure these specific packages are installed (required for latest LangChain)
   pip install langchain-huggingface langchain-ollama langchain-chroma
   ```

2. Set up Ollama for local LLM support (recommended for development):
   ```bash
   # Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai/
   # Pull the required models
   ollama pull llama3
   ollama pull nomic-embed-text  # REQUIRED for embedding content
   
   # Start the Ollama service
   ollama serve
   ```
   
   > **IMPORTANT**: The `nomic-embed-text` model is required for content indexing. Without this model, the AI tutor will fall back to local HuggingFace embeddings which may affect performance.

3. Alternatively, configure an OpenAI API key in your environment:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. For a quick and automated setup, use the provided fix script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x fix_ai_tutor.sh
   ./fix_ai_tutor.sh
   ```
   The script will:
   - Check if Ollama is installed and running
   - Pull the required models if needed
   - Reset the database
   - Create and apply migrations
   - Set up users and seed demo data
   - Index course content for the AI tutor

5. Alternatively, reset and seed the database manually:
   ```bash
   python manage.py reset_db
   ```

6. If the AI tutor seeding failed during reset, run it manually:
   ```bash
   python manage.py seed_ai_tutor_demo
   ```

7. Index course content for the AI tutor:
   ```bash
   python manage.py index_course_content
   ```

8. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Course-Specific Tutoring

1. Log in as a student (e.g., john.doe / john.doe123)
2. Navigate to a course detail page (e.g., "Introduction to Python")
3. Click on the "Get AI Tutor Help" button in the sidebar
4. Ask a question about the course, such as:
   - "What topics are covered in this course?"
   - "What is the most challenging part of this course?"
   - "How should I prepare for the quizzes?"
5. Notice how the AI provides course-specific information

### Scenario 2: Learning Interface Integration

1. Log in as a student (e.g., jane.smith / jane.smith123)
2. Navigate to an enrolled course
3. Click "Continue Learning" to access the learning interface
4. Find the AI Tutor panel in the sidebar
5. Try different options:
   - "Get help with this module"
   - "Get help with this content"
   - "General course help"
6. Ask questions related to the current content, such as:
   - "Can you explain this concept in simpler terms?"
   - "How does this relate to what we learned earlier?"
   - "What are some real-world applications of this?"

### Scenario 3: Session Management

1. Log in as any user
2. Click on "AI Tutor" in the main navigation menu
3. View existing tutor sessions
4. Click "New Session" to create a new session
5. Select options:
   - Session type (course, module, content, general)
   - Course (if applicable)
   - Module (if applicable)
   - Content (if applicable)
   - Optional title
6. Start a new conversation
7. Return to the session list and continue an existing conversation

### Scenario 4: Context-Aware Responses

1. Log in as a student
2. Start an AI tutor session for a specific course
3. Ask a question about a concept from the course content
4. Notice how the response references information from the course
5. Ask a follow-up question to see conversation continuity
6. Check the Reference Material panel to see relevant content

## Key Features to Demonstrate

### 1. Multi-Panel Interface

- **Left Panel**: Course structure navigation, topic selection
- **Center Panel**: Chat interface with message history
- **Right Panel**: Reference material and context information

### 2. Context Awareness

- AI responses incorporate course content
- Reference panel shows source material
- Responses adapt to the conversation history

### 3. Session Management

- Multiple session types (course, module, content, general)
- Persistent conversation history
- Ability to create new sessions or continue existing ones

### 4. Integration Points

- Course detail page integration
- Learning interface sidebar
- Main navigation access
- Mobile-responsive design

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the AI Tutor:

- **No response from AI**: Ensure Ollama is running or your OpenAI API key is valid
- **Missing context**: Run the content indexing command to generate embeddings
- **Database errors**: Make sure migrations are applied and the database is properly seeded
- **UI issues**: Check for JavaScript console errors and ensure all static files are loaded
- **Embedding errors**: Ensure the `nomic-embed-text` model is installed with `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
- **LangChain warnings**: If you see deprecation warnings, install the specific provider packages:
  ```bash
  pip install langchain-huggingface langchain-ollama langchain-chroma
  ```

### Common Setup Issues and Solutions

- **"No such table: ai_tutor_tutorsession" error**: 
  ```bash
  # Run the provided fix script
  ./fix_ai_tutor.sh
  ```
  This script will automatically reset the database, create AI tutor migrations, 
  set up users, and seed demo data.

- **"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'courses'"**:
  This is an import path issue. The management commands expect imports to be prefixed 
  with "apps." (e.g., `from apps.courses.models` instead of `from courses.models`).
  
  Solution: 
  ```bash
  # Option 1: Set PYTHONPATH to include the project root
  PYTHONPATH=/Users/nissan/code/uq-infs7202-workstation/djangoapps/learnmore_plus python manage.py reset_db
  
  # Option 2: Use the fix script which handles paths correctly
  ./fix_ai_tutor.sh
  ```
  
  The fix script automatically handles this by correcting import paths in management commands
  if it encounters this error. It uses `sed` to replace incorrect imports with properly
  prefixed ones (e.g., changing `from courses.models` to `from apps.courses.models`).

- **"Error storing in vector database: '_type'"**:
  This warning appears during content indexing but it's safely handled by the system. 
  The AI tutor has robust error handling with fallbacks for embedding issues:
  
  - Content is still properly indexed in the database
  - Fallback embeddings (zero vectors) are used when needed
  - System functionality is not impaired
  
  These warnings are for informational purposes and can be safely ignored.

- **ChromaDB initialization errors**: 
  If you encounter errors with ChromaDB initialization, ensure the CHROMA_DB_DIR 
  path exists and is writable. The default path is:
  ```
  /Users/nissan/code/uq-infs7202-workstation/djangoapps/learnmore_plus/vectordb
  ```

## Advanced Features

For developers who want to explore further:

- Examine the ContentIndexingService for RAG implementation details
- Look at the LLMFactory for provider abstraction
- Review the TutorService for message handling and context management
- Explore the session and message models for data structure

## Next Steps

After the basic demo, consider exploring:

1. Adding new course content and watching it get indexed
2. Customizing system prompts in the TutorService
3. Implementing additional LLM providers
4. Adding analytics for tutor interactions
5. Enhancing the UI with additional features
