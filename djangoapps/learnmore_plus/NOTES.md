### Issues and Solutions

1. Virtual Environment Issues
   - Problem: Commands failing due to missing virtual environment activation
   - Solution: Added proper virtual environment activation steps
   - Note: Always ensure virtual environment is activated before running Django commands

2. Package Installation
   - Problem: Missing Pillow package for image handling
   - Solution: Added Pillow to requirements
   - Note: Need to update requirements.txt with all dependencies

3. Template Structure
   - Problem: Initial template structure was too flat
   - Solution: Created proper directory structure for templates
   - Note: Better organization for maintainability

4. Missing Dependencies
   - Problem: Server startup failed due to missing requests package
   - Solution: Added requests>=2.31.0 to base.txt
   - Note: django-allauth requires requests for OAuth authentication
   - Impact: Server now starts successfully

5. JWT Authentication
   - Problem: Server startup failed due to missing PyJWT package
   - Solution: Added PyJWT>=2.8.0 to base.txt
   - Note: django-allauth requires PyJWT for Google OAuth authentication
   - Impact: Server now starts successfully
   - Lesson: Some packages have indirect dependencies that need to be explicitly installed

6. Cryptography Requirements
   - Problem: Server startup failed due to missing cryptography package
   - Solution: Added cryptography>=42.0.0 to base.txt
   - Note: django-allauth requires cryptography for JWT handling
   - Impact: Server now starts successfully
   - Lesson: Security-related packages often have additional dependencies

7. Deprecated Settings
   - Problem: Warnings about deprecated allauth settings
   - Solution: Updated to new settings format
   - Changes:
     - ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD → ACCOUNT_LOGIN_METHODS
     - ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED → ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FIELDS
     - ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED → ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FIELDS
   - Impact: Removed deprecation warnings

8. Migration Issues
   - Problem: Inconsistent migration history
   - Solution: Need to reset migrations and apply in correct order
   - Steps:
     1. Remove existing migrations
     2. Create fresh migrations
     3. Apply migrations in correct order
   - Note: This is a common issue when adding custom user model after initial setup

9. Course Enrollment
   - Problem: Enrollment model naming inconsistency
   - Solution: Standardized on CourseEnrollment model
   - Changes:
     - Removed duplicate Enrollment model
     - Updated views to use CourseEnrollment
     - Fixed template references
   - Impact: Consistent enrollment handling

10. Course Learning Interface
    - Problem: Module navigation not working
    - Solution: Implemented proper module and content retrieval
    - Changes:
      - Added first module/content retrieval
      - Created module navigation
      - Added progress tracking
    - Impact: Functional learning interface

### Decisions and Rationale

1. Custom User Model
   - Decision: Created custom user model instead of using Django's default
   - Rationale: Needed additional fields for user profiles
   - Impact: Allows for future expansion of user features

2. Authentication Backend
   - Decision: Used django-allauth for social authentication
   - Rationale: Comprehensive solution with multiple providers
   - Impact: Easy to add more social login providers in future

3. Styling Approach
   - Decision: Used Tailwind CSS instead of Bootstrap
   - Rationale: More flexible and modern approach
   - Impact: Better performance and easier customization

4. Course Structure
   - Decision: Used module-based course organization
   - Rationale: Flexible and scalable content structure
   - Impact: Easy to add and organize course content

5. Learning Interface
   - Decision: Implemented progressive content display
   - Rationale: Better learning experience
   - Impact: Clear content organization and navigation

### Next Steps

1. Database Migration
   - Need to create and apply migrations for custom user model
   - Need to set up PostgreSQL for production

2. Email Configuration
   - Need to configure email backend for verification
   - Need to create email templates

3. Profile Management
   - Need to create profile views

# Development Notes

## April 30, 2025 - Enrollment and Progress Tracking

### Enrollment System Architecture
- Using two enrollment models for different purposes:
  1. `CourseEnrollment`: Basic enrollment tracking
  2. `Enrollment`: Detailed progress tracking with module-level granularity

### Progress Tracking Implementation
- Progress is calculated at multiple levels:
  1. Course level: Overall completion percentage
  2. Module level: Individual module completion
  3. Content level: Progress through course materials

### Time Tracking
- Course duration calculation:
  ```python
  total_duration = sum(
      content.estimated_time or 0
      for module in course.modules.all()
      for content in module.contents.all()
  )
  ```
- Time spent calculation:
  ```python
  time_spent = int(total_duration * (enrollment.progress / 100))
  ```
- Time remaining calculation:
  ```python
  time_remaining = total_duration - time_spent
  ```

### Database Optimizations
- Using `select_related` and `prefetch_related` for efficient queries
- Prefetching course modules and contents to reduce database hits
- Caching calculated values on course objects

### Known Issues and Solutions
1. Enrollment Duplication
   - Solution: Check both enrollment models before creating new records
   - Implementation: Added checks in `course_enroll` view

2. Progress Synchronization
   - Solution: Update both enrollment models when progress changes
   - Implementation: Added synchronization in `course_learn` view

3. Time Calculation
   - Solution: Calculate time based on content estimated_time
   - Implementation: Added time calculations in learning progress view
