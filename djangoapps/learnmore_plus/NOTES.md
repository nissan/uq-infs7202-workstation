# Implementation Notes

## Authentication System Implementation

### Initial Setup (2024-03-XX)
1. Created base template with Tailwind CSS and shadcn-ui setup
   - Used CDN for Tailwind CSS
   - Added shadcn-ui for component styling
   - Implemented dark mode support
   - Created custom CSS variables for consistent theming

2. Created home page template
   - Implemented all sections from mockup
   - Converted Bootstrap classes to Tailwind CSS
   - Added responsive design
   - Maintained all content and functionality

3. Set up static files structure
   - Created directories for CSS, JS, and images
   - Added custom CSS for additional styling
   - Configured static files in settings.py

### Authentication Implementation (2024-03-XX)
1. Created accounts app
   - Used Django's built-in user management
   - Added custom user model with additional fields
   - Implemented email verification
   - Added password reset functionality

2. Added Google OAuth authentication
   - Installed django-allauth
   - Configured Google OAuth settings
   - Created social login templates
   - Added social login buttons to login/register pages

3. Created authentication templates
   - Login template with social login
   - Registration template with social login
   - Password reset templates
   - Email verification templates

### Issues and Solutions

1. Virtual Environment Issues
   - Problem: Commands failing due to missing virtual environment activation
   - Solution: Added proper virtual environment activation steps
   - Note: Always ensure virtual environment is activated before running Django commands

2. Package Installation
   - Problem: Missing Pillow package for image handling
   - Solution: Added Pillow to requirements
   - Note: Need to update requirements.txt with all dependencies

3. Template Structure
   - Problem: Initial template structure was too flat
   - Solution: Created proper directory structure for templates
   - Note: Better organization for maintainability

4. Missing Dependencies
   - Problem: Server startup failed due to missing requests package
   - Solution: Added requests>=2.31.0 to base.txt
   - Note: django-allauth requires requests for OAuth authentication
   - Impact: Server now starts successfully

5. JWT Authentication
   - Problem: Server startup failed due to missing PyJWT package
   - Solution: Added PyJWT>=2.8.0 to base.txt
   - Note: django-allauth requires PyJWT for Google OAuth authentication
   - Impact: Server now starts successfully
   - Lesson: Some packages have indirect dependencies that need to be explicitly installed

6. Cryptography Requirements
   - Problem: Server startup failed due to missing cryptography package
   - Solution: Added cryptography>=42.0.0 to base.txt
   - Note: django-allauth requires cryptography for JWT handling
   - Impact: Server now starts successfully
   - Lesson: Security-related packages often have additional dependencies

7. Deprecated Settings
   - Problem: Warnings about deprecated allauth settings
   - Solution: Updated to new settings format
   - Changes:
     - ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD → ACCOUNT_LOGIN_METHODS
     - ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED → ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FIELDS
     - ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED → ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FIELDS
   - Impact: Removed deprecation warnings

8. Migration Issues
   - Problem: Inconsistent migration history
   - Solution: Need to reset migrations and apply in correct order
   - Steps:
     1. Remove existing migrations
     2. Create fresh migrations
     3. Apply migrations in correct order
   - Note: This is a common issue when adding custom user model after initial setup

### Decisions and Rationale

1. Custom User Model
   - Decision: Created custom user model instead of using Django's default
   - Rationale: Needed additional fields for user profiles
   - Impact: Allows for future expansion of user features

2. Authentication Backend
   - Decision: Used django-allauth for social authentication
   - Rationale: Comprehensive solution with multiple providers
   - Impact: Easy to add more social login providers in future

3. Styling Approach
   - Decision: Used Tailwind CSS instead of Bootstrap
   - Rationale: More flexible and modern approach
   - Impact: Better performance and easier customization

### Next Steps

1. Database Migration
   - Need to create and apply migrations for custom user model
   - Need to set up PostgreSQL for production

2. Email Configuration
   - Need to configure email backend for verification
   - Need to create email templates

3. Profile Management
   - Need to create profile views
   - Need to implement profile picture upload
   - Need to add profile editing functionality

### Lessons Learned

1. Always activate virtual environment before running commands
2. Keep track of all dependencies in requirements.txt
3. Plan template structure before implementation
4. Consider future scalability when making architectural decisions
5. Check for indirect dependencies of installed packages
6. Some packages may have dependencies that aren't automatically installed
7. Security-related packages often have additional dependencies
8. Check for deprecated settings when using third-party packages
9. Plan migration strategy when adding custom user model

### Revision History

1. Initial template structure
   - Original: Flat structure
   - Revised: Proper directory structure
   - Reason: Better organization and maintainability

2. Authentication approach
   - Original: Basic Django auth
   - Revised: django-allauth with social login
   - Reason: More comprehensive solution

3. Styling framework
   - Original: Bootstrap
   - Revised: Tailwind CSS
   - Reason: More flexible and modern approach

### Dependency Management

1. Updated base.txt (2024-03-XX)
