## Test Management

We've documented our approach to testing across multiple files:

- RUNNING_TESTS.md provides instructions for different test types

The test suite now covers:
- Model validation and behavior tests
- API endpoint tests
- Template rendering tests
- Edge case handling (e.g., quiz time limits, concurrent attempts)

## Timeline
