# AI Tutor System Documentation

## Overview

The AI Tutor system provides personalized learning assistance to students using large language models (LLMs) coupled with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The system allows students to ask questions, discuss course topics, and receive relevant information tailored to their learning context.

## Architecture

The AI Tutor system consists of the following components:

### 1. Core Models

- **TutorSession**: Represents a conversation session between a user and the AI tutor
- **TutorMessage**: Individual messages in a conversation, with types 'user', 'tutor', and 'system'
- **TutorKnowledgeBase**: Content snippets for the AI tutor to draw from
- **TutorFeedback**: User feedback on tutor responses
- **TutorConfiguration**: Configuration settings for the AI model

### 2. User Interface

- **Dashboard**: Lists all tutor sessions for a user
- **Session Interface**: Chat interface for interacting with the AI tutor
- **Feedback System**: Allows users to rate and comment on AI responses

### 3. AI Backend (LangChain)

- **Vector Storage**: Stores embeddings of course content for semantic search
- **Retrieval System**: Finds relevant knowledge base items for user questions
- **LLM Integration**: Connects to language models for response generation
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation context and history

## User Flow

1. User creates a new tutor session, optionally linking it to a specific course/module
2. User asks questions or requests explanations in the chat interface
3. System retrieves relevant knowledge and generates contextual responses
4. User can provide feedback on responses to improve future interactions
5. Session history is preserved for continuity of learning

## Technical Implementation

### Models

The AI Tutor app uses Django models to represent the core data structures:

```python
# Key model relationships
TutorSession
  - user (ForeignKey to User)
  - course (ForeignKey to Course, optional)
  - module (ForeignKey to Module, optional)
  - messages (reverse relation to TutorMessage)
  - feedback (reverse relation to TutorFeedback)

TutorMessage
  - session (ForeignKey to TutorSession)
  - message_type (choices: 'user', 'tutor', 'system')
  - content (TextField)
  - metadata (JSONField for additional data)

TutorKnowledgeBase
  - course (ForeignKey to Course, optional)
  - module (ForeignKey to Module, optional)
  - title, content
  - vector_embedding (JSONField for storing embeddings)
```

### API Endpoints

The AI Tutor provides both template-based views and REST API endpoints:

- **Template Views**: `/ai-tutor/` (dashboard), `/ai-tutor/sessions/<id>/` (chat interface)
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/ai-tutor/sessions/`, `/api/ai-tutor/messages/`, etc.

### LangChain Integration

The AI backend uses LangChain for:

1. **Document processing**: Chunking and embedding course content
2. **Vector storage**: Storing embeddings for semantic search
3. **Retrieval**: Finding relevant content based on user questions
4. **Chain construction**: Building prompts with context and history
5. **LLM interaction**: Generating responses using language models

```python
# Example LangChain integration pattern (pseudocode)
def get_tutor_response(session, user_message):
    # Get conversation history
    history = get_conversation_history(session)
    
    # Retrieve relevant documents
    query = user_message.content
    relevant_docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query)
    
    # Build prompt with context
    prompt = build_prompt(
        user_query=query,
        history=history,
        course_context=session.course,
        documents=relevant_docs
    )
    
    # Get LLM response
    response = llm.generate(prompt)
    
    return response
```

## Deployment and Performance

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Response generation happens asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI
- **Caching**: Common queries and responses are cached to improve performance
- **Scalability**: Vector store and LLM services can be scaled independently

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-modal Support**: Adding support for image and diagram understanding
2. **Interactive Exercises**: Generate practice problems and quizzes
3. **Learning Path Optimization**: Suggest personalized learning paths
4. **Real-time Collaboration**: Allow instructors to join AI tutor sessions
5. **Enhanced Analytics**: Track student learning progress through tutor interactions

## Security and Privacy

- User conversations are private to the user and course instructors
- Personal data is not used to train LLMs
- AI responses are filtered for appropriateness
- Session data is encrypted at rest
- Vector embeddings cannot be reversed to obtain original content

## Development Guidelines

When extending the AI Tutor system:

1. Always maintain conversation context across sessions
2. Responses should be educational, not just factual
3. Implement feedback loops to improve response quality
4. Use retrieval to ground responses in course materials
5. Ensure responses are appropriately cited when drawing from sources
6. Follow Django best practices for model and view implementation
