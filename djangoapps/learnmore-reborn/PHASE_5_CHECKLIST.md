## API & Serializers

- [x] Create serializers for choices:
  - [x] `ChoiceSerializer` (without correct answer)
  - [x] `ChoiceWithCorrectAnswerSerializer` (with correct answer)
- [x] Create question serializers:
  - [x] Base `QuestionSerializer`
  - [x] `MultipleChoiceQuestionSerializer` with choices
  - [x] `MultipleChoiceQuestionCreateSerializer` for creating questions with choices
  - [x] `TrueFalseQuestionSerializer`
- [x] Create quiz serializers:
  - [x] `QuizListSerializer` with basic information
  - [x] `QuizDetailSerializer` with questions and context-aware correct answers
- [x] Create attempt serializers:
  - [x] `QuestionResponseSerializer`
  - [x] `QuizAttemptSerializer` with basic stats
  - [x] `QuizAttemptDetailSerializer` with response details
- [x] Wire up DRF viewsets:
  - [x] `QuizViewSet` with permission handling
  - [x] `MultipleChoiceQuestionViewSet` and `TrueFalseQuestionViewSet`
  - [x] `QuizAttemptViewSet` for attempt management

  - [x] `complete` action for finishing attempts
  - [x] `result` action for viewing scores
- [x] Add URL patterns in `courses/api_urls.py`

## UI Components

- [x] Create quiz list template:
  - [x] Implement filtering and search
  - [x] Add responsive quiz cards
  - [x] Show quiz metadata (time limit, passing score)
  - [x] Display attempt history indicators
- [x] Create quiz detail template:
  - [x] Display quiz instructions and parameters
  - [x] Show previous attempt summary
  - [x] Add start quiz button with attempt limit check
  - [x] List related quizzes in course
- [x] Create quiz assessment interface:
  - [x] Implement timer with auto-submit
  - [x] Create question navigation and progress bar
  - [x] Handle different question types (MCQ, T/F)
  - [x] Add auto-save on navigation
  - [x] Create finish and abandon quiz modals
- [x] Create quiz results template:
  - [x] Display overall score and pass/fail status
  - [x] Show detailed question-level feedback
  - [x] Include explanations and correct answers
  - [x] Provide retake option when allowed
- [x] Create quiz attempt history template:
  - [x] List all attempts with stats
  - [x] Show performance metrics
  - [x] Provide access to detailed results

## Auto-Grading Logic

- [x] Implement `check_answer()` in `MultipleChoiceQuestion`:
  - [x] Handle single correct answer case
  - [x] Handle multiple correct answers case
  - [x] Return correctness, points, and feedback
- [x] Implement `check_answer()` in `TrueFalseQuestion`:
  - [x] Convert various input formats to boolean
  - [x] Compare with correct answer
  - [x] Return correctness, points, and feedback
- [x] Implement `QuestionResponse.check_answer()`:
  - [x] Dispatch to appropriate question type
  - [x] Store results and feedback
- [x] Implement `QuizAttempt.calculate_score()`:
  - [x] Sum points from responses
  - [x] Calculate percentage against maximum
  - [x] Determine pass/fail status
- [x] Connect quiz completion to module progress

## Tests

- [x] Test quiz edge cases:
  - [x] Time limit expiration
  - [x] Multiple correct answers
  - [x] Randomized question order
  - [x] Maximum attempt limits
  - [x] Concurrent quiz attempts
