# Phase 4: Learning Interface & Progress Tracking Checklist

This checklist covers migrating the learning interface and progress tracking features into the `learnmore-reborn` app.

## Models & Migrations

- [x] Update `Progress` model in `progress/models.py` to track:
  - [x] Module-level progress
  - [x] Content completion status
  - [x] Timestamp for last activity
  - [x] Total duration spent
- [x] Add learning activity related fields to `Module` model:
  - [x] Content type (video, text, interactive)
  - [x] Estimated completion time
  - [x] Prerequisites (if any)
- [x] Run `makemigrations progress courses` and commit migrations

## Admin

- [x] Register enhanced `Progress` model in Django Admin
- [x] Add learning progress management interface
- [x] Add module content management features:
  - [x] Content organization
  - [x] Prerequisites management
  - [x] Completion tracking overview

## API & Serializers

- [x] Create or update `ProgressSerializer` in `progress/serializers.py`
- [x] Update `ModuleSerializer` with learning-specific fields
- [x] Wire up DRF viewsets or APIViews for:
  - [x] `GET /api/progress/progress/` (get all progress for user)
  - [x] `GET /api/progress/progress/course/?course_id={id}` (get progress for specific course)
  - [x] `POST /api/progress/module-progress/{id}/complete/` (mark module as completed)
  - [x] `GET /api/progress/progress/continue_learning/` (get next incomplete module)
  - [x] `GET /api/progress/progress/stats/` (get learning statistics)
  - [x] `POST /api/progress/progress/{id}/reset/` (reset progress for course)
- [x] Add URL patterns in `progress/api_urls.py`

## UI Components

- [x] Create learning interface template
- [x] Implement module navigation component
- [x] Add progress indicator UI
- [x] Create continue learning section
- [x] Add learning statistics dashboard
- [x] Implement responsive content display
- [x] Create progress reset confirmation UI

## Tests

- [x] Write unit tests for:
  - [x] Progress model
  - [x] Learning interface serializers
  - [x] Progress tracking logic
- [x] Write API tests for:
  - [x] Progress endpoints
  - [x] Continue learning functionality
  - [x] Progress statistics
- [x] Add UI component tests
- [x] Test progress tracking edge cases:
  - [x] Partial module completion
  - [x] Course completion
  - [x] Concurrent progress updates
  - [x] Progress reset functionality

## Docs

- [x] Update `README.md` with learning interface and progress tracking setup
- [x] Document API endpoints for progress tracking
- [x] Add learning interface guide
- [x] Document progress tracking implementation details
- [x] Add progress statistics explanation

## Integration

- [x] Ensure progress is updated when modules are viewed
- [x] Connect progress tracking to quiz completion
- [x] Link progress data to user dashboard
- [x] Implement "continue learning" feature on course pages
