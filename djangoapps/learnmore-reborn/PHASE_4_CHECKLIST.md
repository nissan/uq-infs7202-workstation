# Phase 4: Learning Interface & Progress Tracking Checklist

This checklist covers migrating the learning interface and progress tracking features into the `learnmore-reborn` app.

## Models & Migrations

- [ ] Update `Progress` model in `progress/models.py` to track:
  - [ ] Module/content-level progress (not just course-level)
  - [ ] Completion timestamps
  - [ ] Last accessed timestamps
- [ ] Add content types to `Module` model for different learning materials:
  - [ ] Video content
  - [ ] Reading material
  - [ ] Interactive exercises
- [ ] Create `ModuleCompletion` model to track detailed progress within modules
- [ ] Run `makemigrations` and commit migrations

## Admin

- [ ] Enhance `Progress` admin interface with filters and search
- [ ] Add admin views for course progress tracking
- [ ] Create progress report generation in admin
- [ ] Add bulk actions for managing progress data

## API & Serializers

- [ ] Update `ProgressSerializer` with detailed progress tracking fields
- [ ] Create `ModuleProgressSerializer` for individual module progress
- [ ] Create `ContentProgressSerializer` for tracking content within modules
- [ ] Wire up DRF viewsets or APIViews for:
  - [ ] `GET /api/progress/courses/` (list progress for all enrolled courses)
  - [ ] `GET /api/progress/courses/{slug}/` (detailed progress for a specific course)
  - [ ] `GET /api/progress/modules/{id}/` (progress for a specific module)
  - [ ] `POST /api/progress/modules/{id}/mark-complete/` (mark module as completed)
  - [ ] `POST /api/progress/content/{id}/mark-complete/` (mark content item as completed)
  - [ ] `GET /api/progress/dashboard/` (aggregated progress data for dashboard)
- [ ] Add URL patterns in `progress/api_urls.py`

## UI Components

- [ ] Create main learning interface template:
  - [ ] Module navigation sidebar
  - [ ] Content display area
  - [ ] Progress indicators
- [ ] Implement "Continue Learning" page showing all enrolled courses
- [ ] Create detailed course learning view with:
  - [ ] Progress bar for overall course completion
  - [ ] Module list with completion status
  - [ ] Content display for active module
- [ ] Implement module navigation controls:
  - [ ] Next/previous module buttons
  - [ ] Mark as complete button
- [ ] Add progress dashboard for learners:
  - [ ] Progress summary cards
  - [ ] Recent activity
  - [ ] Recommendations for courses/modules to continue
- [ ] Create responsive design for mobile learning

## Progress Tracking Logic

- [ ] Implement automatic progress tracking when viewing content
- [ ] Create progress calculation algorithm for modules and courses
- [ ] Add completion criteria for different content types
- [ ] Implement completion certificates or badges
- [ ] Create "resume learning" functionality (remember where user left off)

## Access Control

- [ ] Add middleware or decorators to check enrollment status for content access
- [ ] Implement content sequence/prerequisites logic:
  - [ ] Lock modules until prerequisites are completed
  - [ ] Control access to advanced content based on progress
- [ ] Create access denied templates with clear enrollment prompts

## Tests

- [ ] Write unit tests for:
  - [ ] Progress models
  - [ ] Progress tracking logic
  - [ ] Progress calculation algorithms
- [ ] Write API tests for:
  - [ ] Progress tracking endpoints
  - [ ] Module/content completion endpoints
  - [ ] Progress dashboard data endpoints
- [ ] Add UI component tests:
  - [ ] Learning interface rendering
  - [ ] Progress bar accuracy
  - [ ] Module navigation
- [ ] Test access control:
  - [ ] Unauthorized access attempts
  - [ ] Prerequisite enforcement
  - [ ] Sequential content access

## Docs

- [ ] Update `README.md` with learning interface and progress tracking info
- [ ] Document API endpoints for progress tracking
- [ ] Create user guide for the learning interface
- [ ] Add developer documentation for extending the progress tracking system
